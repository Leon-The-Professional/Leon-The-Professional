# Heyooo,  

## All About Me  
My name is Leon Hall. When I was a young lad of two, my mother probably said something profoundly inspiring that I can’t remember. What I *do* remember is my brain exploding with ideas about websites and apps while I made exquisitely (if I say so myself) crafted bread.  

I have a degree in Guitar Performance and worked at a bakery for eight years before landing my first developer job. I clearly didn’t take the typical route to a career in development, but I consider this a strength, not a weakness.  

While I was working at the bakery, a friend from the connected kitchen started developing WordPress websites. He even made a site for another buddy of ours to sell and showcase his art. He offered to build me a site for free (as practice) if I came up with an idea, and ohhhhh did that light a fire in my amygdala. Over the next few days, I came up with a *lot* of ideas, and soon he and I began mapping out some great and wondrous plans for a website. However, there were a couple of catches.  

The first catch: his development skills were fairly limited (mine were non-existent), and he mostly relied on assembling widgets created by others. As our ideas for the site grew, his ability to implement them diminished.  

The second—and biggest—issue: he was moving away. We both knew that continuing our plans for the website would be inefficient at best, so we gracefully let the idea go.  

*BUT* I was already hooked. I had so many ideas, and the list kept growing. After those two catches derailed our project, I started looking for basic web development tutorials online. I began with small, free courses before moving on to Udemy, where I completed full certification courses in web development and Git.  

Through a chance encounter with a friendly acquaintance, I heard about an opening for an entry-level software support position at Malouf. I set to work creating some snazzy GitHub pages for a portfolio and sent in my application—with tears in my eyes (I was eating spicy salsa at the time). I feel extremely fortunate that, despite my lack of experience or a CS degree, I was not only granted an interview but also given a chance to break into the field.  

I *loved* working as a software developer at Malouf. My department’s “amazing people to work with” cup truly did runneth over. I’ll always be grateful for everything they taught me and for the camaraderie they shared with me. I was shown so much trust, patience, and respect—even when I was at the bottom of the totem pole.  

Working at Malouf gave me a wide range of experiences, including EDI transactions, third-party API integrations, collaborating with other departments on feature requests, AWS workflow and database monitoring, and even dealing with (or working around) a legacy in-house framework that the software was originally built on. Since starting at Malouf, my passion for development has only grown, and I’m beyond excited for whatever opportunity comes next.  

## What I’m Working On  
Unfortunately, I was part of a late round of layoffs at Malouf, but the silver lining is that I now have time to bring one of my ideas to life. I’m currently developing a website designed to simplify and enhance gift giving by providing curated suggestions for gift recipients.  

When starting this project, I chose a stack that balanced familiar technology with some new frameworks and tools. For example, I opted for PostgreSQL over my usual MySQL, knowing there’d be enough similarities to stay productive while learning something new. I’m also using <a href='https://inertiajs.com/'>Inertia.js</a>, which, rather than presenting a meaningful challenge, has actually made everything cleaner and simpler so far.  

This is my first time building and deploying a full project, and I wanted to take it a step further. A good friend and former coworker from Malouf gave me an old server of his. With his help, I’ve gotten it back in shape and running smoothly. When my site is ready to go public, I’ll be hosting it on my own server—and I’m super hyped about it.  

## Project Tech Stack  
- **Frontend**: Sass, Vue  
- **Backend**: Laravel  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL  
- **Other Tools**: Git, Linux, Inertia.js  
- **Machine**: Linux (Pop!_OS)  

## The Future  
I’m actively looking for a new role to dive into (AKA, I’m open to work) and couldn’t be more excited about what’s ahead. In the meantime, I’ll be building the website that will change gift-giving forever. FOREVER.
