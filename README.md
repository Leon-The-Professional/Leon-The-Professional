# Hi, I'm Leon Hall 👋

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a 36-year-old web developer with a unique journey from studying music to working in software development.

## :speech_balloon: About Me
I graduated from Utah State University (USU) in 2012 with a BA in Music. After realizing that teaching music wasn't the right fit for me, I took a detour and worked at the USU bakery while I figured out what direction to take next.
During my time at the bakery, I began teaching myself web development through online courses and bootcamps. The world of coding really grabbed my attention, and I knew I had found something I wanted to pursue full-time.
After months of self-study, I was fortunate to land an entry-level position at Malouf, where I got my foot in the door of the tech world. Since then, I've been sharpening my skills and taking on new challenges every day.

## 🔧 My Current Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Vue.js
- **Backend**: PHP, Laravel
- **Database**: MySQL, PostgreSQL
- **Other Tools**: Docker, Git, API integration, Linux

## 🛠️ What I'm Working On
Currently, I'm working on **Giftyr**, a public website designed to simplify gift shopping by providing curated suggestions and tracking past gifts. 
**Stack**: Vue/Laravel/PostgreSQL

## 🌱 Always Learning
I'm always on the lookout for new technologies and challenges to keep expanding my skillset. Right now, I'm also preparing for the **AWS Certified Developer** exam and exploring more about cloud computing.
