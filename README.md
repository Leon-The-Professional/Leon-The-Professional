# Hi, I'm Leon Hall üëã

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a 36-year-old web developer with a unique journey from studying music to working in software development.

## :speech_balloon: About Me
I graduated from Utah State University (USU) in 2012 with a BA in Music. After realizing that teaching music wasn't the right fit for me, I took a detour and worked at the USU bakery while I figured out what direction to take next.
During my time at the bakery, I began teaching myself web development through online courses and bootcamps. The world of coding really grabbed my attention, and I knew I had found something I wanted to pursue full-time.

## üåü My Break into Development
After months of self-study, I was fortunate to land an entry-level position at Malouf, where I joined an amazing group of developers. During my time there, I gained experience working with an old in-house PHP framework as well as with **Laravel**. I contributed to various **API and EDI integrations**, utilized **AWS** for file sharing, and collaborated with different teams across the company to develop and maintain software that supported our company‚Äôs goals.

## :nut_and_bolt: My Role at Malouf
At Malouf, I worked on a wide range of projects, including:
- **Front-End and Back-End Development**: Refactoring legacy code and adding new features using modern syntax.
- **Debugging, Security, and Testing**: Ensuring our systems were reliable, secure, and efficient.
- **Inner Company and Third-Party Requests**: Creating integrations with third-party services via API and EDI.
- **Collaboration Across Teams**: Working with other developers, sales teams, accounting, and external partners to deliver solutions that enhanced business efficiency.
  
## üîß My Current Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Vue.js
- **Backend**: PHP, Laravel
- **Database**: MySQL, PostgreSQL
- **Other Tools**: Docker, Git, API integration, Linux

## üõ†Ô∏è What I'm Working On
Currently, I'm working on **Giftyr**, a public website designed to simplify gift shopping by providing curated suggestions and tracking past gifts. 
**Stack**: Vue/Laravel/PostgreSQL

## üå± Always Learning
I'm always on the lookout for new technologies and challenges to keep expanding my skillset. Right now, I'm also preparing for the **AWS Certified Developer** exam and exploring more about cloud computing.
