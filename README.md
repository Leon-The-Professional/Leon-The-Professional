# 👋 Hey, I’m Leon

💼 **Open to Software Developer roles**

Full-stack developer focused on building thoughtful, scalable web applications with Laravel and Vue.

I didn’t take the traditional CS route into development — I started in music and spent years managing systems in a bakery before transitioning into software. That background shaped how I approach engineering: practical, collaborative, and outcome-driven.

## 🛠 What I Do

- Build full-stack **Laravel + Vue** applications  
- Design relational database schemas  
- Integrate third-party APIs (EDI, REST, AWS S3)  
- Improve reliability with testing and static analysis (PHPStan)  
- Refactor legacy systems into maintainable, modern code  
- Ship features end-to-end  

I enjoy building internal tools, solving workflow problems, and making complex systems easier to work with.

## 🚀 What I’m Building

I’m currently developing a **gift tracking web application** designed to simplify how people manage recipients, events, and gift history.

**Tech Stack:**
- Laravel  
- Vue 3 + Inertia.js  
- PostgreSQL  
- Linux-based deployment  

The current focus is building a solid, scalable foundation (authentication, relational modeling, data isolation) before layering on more advanced recommendation logic.

And yes — I’ll be deploying it myself.

## 🔍 What I’m Looking For

I’m seeking a stable and engaging software development role where I can:

- Contribute to meaningful products  
- Collaborate with thoughtful engineers  
- Continue growing in backend architecture and system design  
- Build reliable, maintainable software at scale  

Remote-friendly preferred, but open to strong teams wherever they are.
